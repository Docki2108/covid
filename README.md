Ð¡ourse project :)

## INFO

This project is a course project in my college.
(my first experience with flutter)

The software should help the user in monitoring their health, informing them about the coronavirus and its symptoms.

- The application is implemented using the Flutter cross-platform development framework in the Dart programming language.
- The cloud-based Nosql database Firebase Firestore is used as the database of the software product.
- The Firebase Authentication service is responsible for authenticating users in the application.
